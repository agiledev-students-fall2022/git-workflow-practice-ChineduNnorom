## Why I find this Interesting:

I found this article to be interesting because it details the interview process of Software Engineering Jobs.
Being that I am a fourth year student, and am expected to graduate in May of 2023, I am deep in the midst of
many job applications and potential interviews. I have been partaking in such interviews since I was a freshman
in college, and I still find them extremely difficult to get through. This article details about how most technical interviews for tech companies are live, in front of one or two engineers for the company you are interviewing for. The article also explains how this type of environment is not very indicative of what the actual job is like. I can relate to that because I am more of a trial and error coder, which may not be the best but that is how I am. When I see a problem I go with my initial idea and debug from there. However, that is almost the complete opposite of what is expected in these coding interviews. From the many friends I have that are currently working full-time at tech companies, the advice given from them all is "study, study, study", and this is confirmed in this article. It seems there are no ways around this fact, and the only way to get to a comoany you desire is to put your head down and work for it. 

Another thing I found pretty interesting is that the person in the article didn't have much knowledge with Python when she began her first internship at Lyft, she actually had no idea what it was. That was a bit comforting to hear because I know I am constantly worrying that I don't know enough languages because I've only ever taken two courses at NYU that were not in Python. One was in C and the other in C++, so I don't have much knowledge in any other language. Realizing that the people in full-time jobs still google little things like for loops eases my mind a bit, and I know that if I grind and work hard, I can definitely end up where I want to in tech.
